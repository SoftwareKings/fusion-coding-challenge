# Fusion Charts coding challenge
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Your task: Build a simple react app with fusion charts library
#### Project should consist of 3 major components
1. a navigation area with two buttons that when clicked should toggle between two graphs
2. 2 separate graphs of you choosing from the fusionCharts library
 - each graph should pull dynamic data from ANY api of your choosing (these data can be as complex or as simple as you'd like)
 - if you run out of time, you can choose to populate one or both of the graphs with hard-coded data
3. The page should be styled nicely and responsive.
 - see the file `mockup.png` for a basic reference
